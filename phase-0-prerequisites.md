# Welcome to DBC!

You are in your pre-Phase 0 prep period. Before you can start Phase 0, you will need to complete a few administrative tasks and personal preparation. Please go through each of these sections and complete each task. You should be well acquainted with our program by the end and will be ready to start Phase 0 by your start date.

**Please note:** We will send out your "Welcome to Phase 0" email on the Friday prior to your cohort start date to give you access to Dev Bootcamp systems. Please be on the lookout for these messages.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or feedback for the Phase 0 team, please contact us at <phase0@devbootcamp.com>. Please mention your start date in the email.

# Before Entering Phase 0

#### 0. Brief Introduction
Read our [Blog Post](http://devbootcamp.com/2014/05/08/why-phase-0-is-key-to-your-success-at-dev-bootcamp/) on Phase 0.
Phase 0 is an actual Phase of DBC; it is not optional. We cover the fundamentals you will need to be successful in the intensive portion of DBC.

You may be thinking that Phase 0 will not be intense because it is remote, but it is. Please refrain from scheduling any vacations, trips, etc. during Phase 0 unless you expect to do the work during that time and have reliable internet access. There are weekly deadlines for challenges, pairing requirements, and other tasks you will be required to do each week.

Anticipate spending between 15-25 hours a week on your work during Phase 0 (or more if you want to go above and beyond). Also, please do not quit your job before starting the program. You may decide that becoming a programmer isn't for you only a few weeks in, and then it will be very difficult to get your job back! Please wait to quit your jobs until you are at least 2 weeks away from coming onsite for the intensive portion of the program.


#### 1. Create Accounts
You will need each of these accounts prior to Phase 0, and we will ask you to provide links to your Socrates (our student application) profile when you receive your welcome email.

- [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com)<br> We use Google Hangouts and Communities throughout Phase 0. If you would like us to conduct email communications with you via gmail, update your email address in [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) as soon as possible **before** starting Phase 0. **Make sure to activate Google+ on this account**

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)<br>You will be using Twitter throughout Phase 0 and will have some challenges using the Twitter API later.

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)<br> LinkedIn is an important resume tool and a part of your later career search, so it's good to fill it out now with your history and what you've been doing so you have a history.

- [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/)<br> You will get a Socrates account when you start Phase 0, and it will pull your picture from Gravatar. Please make sure your picture is of your face so we can get as much practice with your name as possible. [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com)

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)<br> Is where many techies make contributions or spend time looking for new, exciting things in the tech community. Creating an account allows you to post and reply.

- [Github](https://github.com/)<br> You will start using github on the first day of Phase 0, so please create an account. This will be where you keep all of your code from Dev Bootcamp and becomes your technical resume when you apply for jobs - so you may want to select your username with that in mind.

#### 2. Personal Preparation

You are about to embark on a new learning experience. You will be challenged in new ways that will excite and frustrate you (often at the same time). It's important to prepare yourself for success by recognizing how you learn best and what you enjoy when you are in a learning environment. Recognizing what you need will help you be able to express what you need when learning and make your experience at Dev Bootcamp more fulfilling. You will be spending a significant amount of time working with others, so it's also vital to practice explaining your ideas to others. *Keep track of the your explanations and results below.*

You need to be able to:

- Explain the difference between <a href="http://examinedexistence.com/carol-dweck-on-fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset/" target="_blank">growth and fixed mindset</a>.
- Identify my
<a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire" target="_blank">VARK learning style</a>.
- Explain my <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">thinking style</a> and what I enjoy or find challenging when learning
- Identify strategies to work more effectively. Read [Nine Things Successful People Do Differently](https://hbr.org/2011/02/nine-things-successful-people/) for inspiration.

#### 3. Update your browser
It's very important that you're using the latest version of your web browser. For Phase 0, we recommend working with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/).


#### 4. Typing and shortcuts
It's important to be able to type at a decent clip in this new career you've embarked on! That said, it's not the end of the world if you struggle with typing, just take some time to practice, practice, practice!

Take a baseline <a href = "http://www.typingtest.com/index.html" target="_blank">test</a> to see how fast you currently type.

Then practice. Try <a href = "http://www.typingtest.com/index.html" target="_blank">test</a>[typing.io](http://typing.io/) to practice typing code, which has a ton of strange symbols. Typing can be fun to practice and you can't get too good at it.

For shortcuts, try <a href = "https://www.shortcutfoo.com/" target="_blank">shortcutfoo.com</a>. You'll want to know about some of the awesome sublime text shortcuts.

You need to be able to:
 - Type at least 40 words per minute
 - Use common shortcuts in Sublime

#### 5. Computer setup
We provide computer setup instructions in Week 1 to help you get a developer environment up and running. That said, these instuctions are most beneficial on a computer that has a "clean" environment (i.e. one that hasn't been set up for development before), so please avoid trying to set up your computer in advance of Phase 0 if you haven't already. If you are working on a machine that has already been configured, you may have more issues with setup. 

We highly recommend using either Unix or Linux rather than Windows if you have the option. If you have a Windows machine, it would be good to look into [running Linux on Windows](http://www.howtogeek.com/170870/5-ways-to-run-linux-software-on-windows/) prior to Phase 0. We provide Unix (Apple) computers on site, and Linux commands are more similar to Unix.

#### 6. Read the [Phase 0 Handbook](README.md)
This detailed document outlines the Phase 0 Program in great depth, so please take time to read it and get comfortable with Phase 0 and Dev Bootcamp!

#### 7. Watch
The following videos introduce some key concepts of the Phase 0 experience.
You will be expected to be familiar with each of these prior to starting Phase 0.

- Engineering Empathy: [EQ: Emotional Intelligence](https://vimeo.com/99779530) 15 min
- Giving and Receiving [Feedback](https://vimeo.com/99780302) 27 min
- Checking in before [Pairing](https://vimeo.com/76662569) 5 min

#### 8. Complete the End of Prep Survey
Navigate to [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) and complete the "End of Prep Survey" This is required to start Phase 0.

#### 9. Additional Resources (Optional)
Take a look at a couple of these resources that look interesting to you.

##### Books
- <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050" target="_blank">*Pragmatic Thinking and Learning*</a> by Andy Hunt. This book covers "how our brains are wired, and how to take advantage of your brain's architecture. You'll learn new trice and tips to learn more, faster, and retain more of what you learn."
- <a href = "http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do" target="_blank">*Apprenticeship Patterns*</a> by Dave Hoover. Are you doing all you can to further your career as a software developer? With today's rapidly changing and ever-expanding technologies, being successful requires more than technical expertise. To grow professionally, you also need soft skills and effective learning techniques. Honing those skills is what this book is all about. Authors Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye have cataloged dozens of behavior patterns to help you perfect essential aspects of your craft.
- <a href = "http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer" target="_blank">*The Passionate Programmer*</a> by Chad Fowler. This book is about creating a remarkable career in software development. In most cases, remarkable careers don’t come by chance. They require thought, intention, action, and a willingness to change course when you’ve made mistakes. Most of us have been stumbling around letting our careers take us where they may. It’s time to take control. This revised and updated second edition lays out a strategy for planning and creating a radically successful life in software development.
- <a href="http://www.barbaraoakley.com/books.html" target="_blank">*A Mind for Numbers*</a> by Barbara Oakley. In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. A Mind for Numbers shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think!
- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Intelligent-Touchstone/dp/0671212095" target="_blank">*How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading*</a> With half a million copies in print, How to Read a Book is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for the general reader, completely rewritten and updated with new material. Originally published in 1940, this book is a rare phenomenon, a living classic that introduces and elucidates the various levels of reading and how to achieve them—from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading. Readers will learn when and how to “judge a book by its cover,” and also how to X-ray it, read critically, and extract the author’s message from the text. Also included is instruction in the different techniques that work best for reading particular genres, such as practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science works. Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests you can use measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension, and speed.
