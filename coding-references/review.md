# How to Review Other's Solutions

We use the GitHub feature "Issues" to give feedback to other students. Code Review feedback is not anonymous, and are done via GitHub. The instructions for doing this are below.

### Make sure your repo's "Issues" are enabled
For each Phase 0 Repository, you will need to have Issues enabled to be able to get feedback.

Please do this for each repo you have. Click on **settings** on the "Features" section, add a check next to "Issues." This will allow others to give you feedback on your site!

### How to find other solutions
Take a look at some other students' solutions to the challenges. To do this you can do one of two things:

1. Go to the fork icon at the top of your repo. There should be a number next to it. Click on the number. It will take you to a graph. Above the graph, click on the "members" tab, which will take you to all of the forks. You should be able to see all of them since you are all in a team together.

2. If you go to your cohort in Socrates and click on a person's picture, you can see a person's GitHub name. (You can also view other cohorts in other locations). Substitute their GitHub name in the URL (You'll have to manually manipulate the URL since the repositories are private and won't show up on their main page). Simply type:

https://github.com/[THEIR-USERNAME]/phase-0-unit-1

That will take you to their repository. (Change the URL if you want to see unit 2 or 3 as well).

### Using Issues
We use "Issues" to give people feedback on their code. If the person you are reviewing does not have issues enabled, please email them to remind them to enable that feature.

1. Click on "Issues"
2. Click on "New Issue"
3. Write your feedback (with a title) using Markdown. You can preview your markdown by clicking on the "Preview" tab. *Note:* Issues are general; they do not reference a single file, so please keep that in mind when giving feedback. Make sure you identify which file you are giving feedback for.
4. When you finish, click "Submit new issue"

### Feedback
Practice writing Actionable, Specific, and Kind feedback to other students.

Here are some sample questions to guide your feedback:
- If you were going to implement the pseudocode, would it be easy to follow?
- Proper Variable Naming - make the variable name descriptive and concise
  * Avoid naming variables after the data structure (array, string, arr, hash, hsh, etc)
  * Avoid numbered variables (var1, var2, var3)
  * Avoid single character names (i, x, n)
- Proper Method Naming
  *The name should reflect the method's single responsibility
- Keep it DRY
  * Condense repetitive code
  * Create new methods to encapsulate common functions
- Did you like the logic?
- Was every variable necessary?
- What did the student do well?
- What could they have done better?
- How was their reflection?
- Did you learn anything from this solution?
