# Peer-Pairing Sessions


## Purpose
Pair programming has gained in popularity among companies as enabling developers to learn quickly and make fewer mistakes. Pair programming can enable both partners to learn and grow if communication is open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect. These are skills that are strengthen with practice, which is why we have incorporated pair programming into Phase 0!


Read [Pair Programming Considered Extremely Beneficial](http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/17/pair-programming-considered-extremely-beneficial/)  to further understand the benifits of pair programming.


## Expectations
As part of Phase 0, students are expected to pair program with another student in their cohort, from any location:
* Unit 1: 4 times (You are not expected to pair in week 1).
* Unit 2: 6 times
* Unit 3: 6 times

While it is not mandatory, we encourage students to pair with a different person in each session. This ensures you do not get use to just one person's unique pairing style. We also recommend pairing twice per week, but this is flexible. You can pair more in one week and less in the next.

It is up to each student to arrange pairing sessions. We suggest posting in the Google+ community to request a pairing session. In your post, please state a time/times (including a time zone) and the challenge you want to pair on. Once another student says they are avalible to pair, you should decide whether you will attempt the challenge before the agreed upon time or decide to not work on it before the session.

* A peer pairing session must be 45 minutes.
* You can work on any of the challenges for the week except for the solo challenges.
* You must pair on "Mandatory Pairing" challenges.
* Guided Pairing Sessions (GPS) DO NOT count as peer-pairing sessions.


## Courtesy

Please keep in mind that all students are busy and working hard to balance their non-DBC life (work, family, etc.) and Phase 0 requirements. If it turns out you can not make the session you've scheduled for any reason, please contact your pair as soon as possible. 

Try your best to work from a quiet place with a reliable internet connection. It is usually helpful to have headphones for your sessions as well.


## Success Guidelines

You will be successful in your Peer-Pairing sessions if you:

- Check in with your pair according to the [Pairing is Caring](http://vimeo.com/76662569) video.
- Decide which of you will start as the driver and navigator, discuss what each role requires, and stick with it.
- Alternate between driving and navigating. Aim to spend about 50% of your time in each role.
- Keep communication open and tell your pair when you need time to think.
- Ask your pair for their opinions and ideas often.
- Allow yourself to make mistakes.
- Submit feedback to help your pair improve.
- Use feedback you've received to become a better pair.
	

### Problems and Tips
Most students report that peer-pairing sessions are the most helpful and beneficial aspect of the Phase 0 program, but sometimes students report having bad sessions. Here are some tips for the common complaints we've heard.

**Problem: "My pair isn't responding to my messages."**<br>
*Tip: Try contacting your pair via email. You should have access to their email address on the [Phase 0 App](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com) and [Socrates](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com). If you still have difficulty, email <phase0@devbootcamp.com> we can try to put you in contact with one another.*

**Problem: "My pair stood me up!"**<br>
*Tip: Email your pair and present your side from your perspective. If you say something like, "I felt upset and disrespected by..." Let them know that their actions had consequences. Note: Please do not use feedbackinator to address this kind of issue.*


**Problem: "My pair drove AND navigated during the session."**<br>
*Tips: If you didn't clarify who would drive and navigate from the outset, you can ask to clarify it anytime in the session. If you did identify who would drive and navigate, but you feel you aren't able to play your role, you can ask your pair to take a step back on your duties so you can fulfill them. Try asking questions about potential design choices and offer your own ideas. Finally, if nothing is working, you can tell your pair that you need a break from the session and say you can reschedule for later since you don't feel the session is beneficial at the moment.*
