# Office Hours

Office hours are a time that you can ask questions and bring issues to a Phase 0 guide. Some examples of office hours issues are: looking over code, working through parts of a challenge, problems setting up git, or getting your development environment on track.

You can access the office hours schedule through the Phase 0 App [Office Hours](http://phase0.devbootcamp.com/office_hours) tab. You will be able to join the video call through the provided link when the event occurs.

You do not need to sign up for office hours, just jump into the hangout and ask your questions anytime during that hour. You don't need to stay the whole time.

Please note: office hours are times to get help with concepts in the Phase 0 curriculum. We know that many of you take some extra time to work on other projects you want help on, but advanced questions from these projects should wait for DBC on site.

*If the guide who created the session is not there, please email <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com>.
